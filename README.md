## Description

Welcome to the CodeMantic GitHub repository, a groundbreaking project born from the collective creativity of GROUP 3! CodeMantic isn't your ordinary dating website; it's a community-driven platform designed by developers, for developers. Our mission is to help developers connect, collaborate, and potentially find love in the world of code.

CodeMantic is an unique dating application that brings developers together. Whether you're looking for a coding partner, a friend to discuss tech with, or something more, CodeMantic has got you covered. Here are some of the key features that make CodeMantic special:

- Home Page: Users are welcomed to the home page, where they can choose to either log in if they already have an account or sign up for an exciting coding journey.
- User Profiles: Create or edit your user profile to show-off your favorite hobbies, languages, or operating system.
- Avatar Selection: Choose an avatar to display as your profile picture.
- Date Reviews: After going on dates with fellow developers, leave reviews for each other. But here's the twist: we use HTTP status badges to express your feelings about the date, making it fun and tech-themed!
- Matching Debug: Find potential coding partners or love interests based on shared interests, skills, and more.
